**Contents**

Solving a cars assembly line problem by implementing three algorithmic approaches: an **exhaustive search**, a **greedy algorithm** and a **metaheuristic**.

Codes:

- `exh.cc` (exhaustive search)
- `greedy` (greedy algorithm)
- `mh.cc` (metaheuristic)

In order to check that your solutions are correct, you can use the *checker* we provide: `check`.

The `solve` script automaticallly executes each `easy`, `med` and `hard` public benchs and saves all the solutions found by each of the 3 approaches.
